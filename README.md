**`p0afit`: Fitting for P0-Acc of binary pulsar data**



## Description
This is a `C` package for fitting for P0-Acc of binary pulsar in a circular orbit 

## Principle:

##  [Orbits in the period / acceleration plane](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/staff/pfreire/orbits/index.html).



## Dependencies
`gsl`ï¼Œ`pgplot`

## Usage:
   ```bash
   p0afit   filename
   ```

The input file should be a two col file that include P0(ms) for the 1st col and Acc (m s^-2) for the 2nd col.
